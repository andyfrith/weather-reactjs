A clean, foundational **React.js** application designed to consume the [Weather API](https://github.com/andyfrith/weather-api). This project serves as a streamlined starting point for building modern React frontends with **strict contract-based integration**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📝 Zod OpenAPI Client**: Leverage the power of Zod and OpenAPI to ensure that the data consumed from the API is always valid and correctly typed.
- **🏗️ Foundational Build**: A simple, un-opinionated starting point focused on clean data fetching and state management.
- **🛡️ Contract-First Development**: By using the Zod OpenAPI client, the frontend stays perfectly in sync with the backend's documented schema.
- **⚡ Vite-Powered**: Instant hot-reloading and an optimized build pipeline for a superior developer experience.

## 🔗 The Integration Layer

This client connects to the **Weather API** (Hono/Bun). Instead of loose `fetch` calls, it utilizes a generated or schema-driven client via **Zod OpenAPI**. This eliminates the common "API drift" problem where frontend types become outdated compared to the actual API responses.

### Why this matters:

- **Validation at the Edge**: Data is validated as it enters the React application.
- **Intelligent Autocomplete**: TypeScript knows exactly what the weather object looks like based on the API's OpenAPI specification.
- **Error Resilience**: Unexpected API changes are caught at the networking layer before they crash the UI.
